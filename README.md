# Peer-Review-using-ML

Objective: Various Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches to Classify Scientific Articles.
Description: Articles were classified into seven categories. Different text cleaning methods like stemming and lemmatization were used. Techniques like Random Search Cross Validation for hyper parameter tuning and stratified k-fold cross validation for overfitting were incorporated. Ensemble learning was also used with different models like SVM, LR & SGD. The best accuracy was 93.27%.

Tools: Python, NLTK module, Scikit-learn Library, Jupyter Lab, Kaggle Kernel.
